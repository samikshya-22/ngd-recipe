           <h2>
            ingredients:
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>300g basmati rice.</li>
            <li>25g butter.</li>
            <li>1 large onion, finely sliced</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf.</li>
            <li>3 cardamom pods.</li>
            <li>small cinnamon stick.</li>
            <li>1 tsp turmeric.</li>
            <li>4 skinless chicken breasts, cut into large chunks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Preparation:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, biryani masala powder, salt, lemon juice, chopped coriander leaves, and mint leaves.
                Add chicken pieces to the marinade. Make sure each piece is well coated. Marinate for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator, preferably overnight for best results.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add salt, whole spices (bay leaf, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon), and soaked, drained rice.
                Cook the rice until it's 70-80% done. It should still have a slight bite to it. Drain the rice and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a heavy-bottomed pan or handi, add a layer of marinated chicken at the bottom.
                Top the chicken layer with a layer of partially cooked rice.
                Sprinkle fried onions, saffron milk, and ghee on top of the rice layer.
                Repeat the layers until all the chicken and rice are used up. The top layer should be rice.
                Seal the lid with dough or a tight-fitting lid to trap the steam.</li>
            <li>Place the sealed pot on low heat and let it cook for about 20-25 minutes. You can also place a tawa (griddle) under the pot to ensure even heat distribution.
                After 20-25 minutes, turn off the heat and let the biryani sit for another 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
                <li>Gently fluff up the biryani with a fork, taking care not to break the rice grains.
                    Serve hot garnished with fried onions, fresh coriander leaves, and mint leaves.
                    Enjoy your delicious Hyderabadi Chicken Dum Biryani with raita and salad on the side.</li>
